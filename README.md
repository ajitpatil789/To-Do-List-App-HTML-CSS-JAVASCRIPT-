To-Do List App
A simple, responsive, and interactive To-Do List application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This app helps users manage their tasks efficiently by allowing them to add, mark as completed, and delete tasks.

Features
Add Tasks: Users can add new tasks to their to-do list.
Mark as Complete: Tasks can be marked as completed with a single click.
Delete Tasks: Remove tasks from the list once they're done or no longer needed.
Responsive Design: Fully responsive layout that works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
Local Storage Support: Your tasks are saved in your browser's local storage, so they persist even after refreshing the page.

Technologies Used
HTML: To structure the application.
CSS: For styling and responsive design.
JavaScript: To handle app logic and interactivity.

How It Works
Open the app in your browser.
Use the input field to add tasks and click the "Add" button to save them.
Click on a task to mark it as completed (it will be styled differently).
Use the "Delete" button next to a task to remove it from the list.
All tasks are saved in the browser's local storage and will reappear when you reopen the app.
